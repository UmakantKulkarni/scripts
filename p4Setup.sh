# TBD: Should these packages be installed via apt-get ?  They are in

# zlib1g-dev18

# On a freshly installed Ubuntu 20.04.1 or 18.04.5 system, desktop
# amd64 minimal installation, the Debian package python3-protobuf is
# installed.  This is depended upon by another package called
# python3-macaroonbakery, which in turn is is depended upon by a
# package called gnome-online accounts.  I suspect this might have
# something to do with Ubuntu's desire to make it easy to connect with
# on-line accounts like Google accounts.

# This python3-protobuf package enables one to have a session like
# this with no error, on a freshly installed system:

# $ python3
# >>> import google.protobuf

# However, something about this script doing its work causes a
# conflict between the Python3 protobuf module installed by this
# script, and the one installed by the package python3-protobuf, such
# that the import statement above gives an error.  The package
# google.protobuf.internal is used by the p4lang/tutorials Python
# code, and the only way I know to make this work right now is to
# remove the Debian python3-protobuf package, and then install Python3
# protobuf support using pip3 as done below.

# Experiment starting from a freshly installed Ubuntu 20.04.1 Linux
# desktop amd64 system, minimal install:
# Initially, python3-protobuf package was installed.
# Doing python3 followed 'import' of any of these gave no error:
# + google
# + google.protobuf
# + google.protobuf.internal
# Then did 'sudo apt-get purge python3-protobuf'
# At that point, attempting to import any of the 3 modules above gave an error.
# Then did 'sudo apt-get install python3-pip'
# At that point, attempting to import any of the 3 modules above gave an error.
# Then did 'sudo pip3 install protobuf==3.6.1'
# At that point, attempting to import any of the 3 modules above gave NO error.

sudo apt-get purge -y python3-protobuf || echo "Failed to remove python3-protobuf, probably because there was no such package installed"
sudo pip3 install protobuf==3.6.1

# Starting in 2019-Nov, Python3 version of Scapy is needed for `cd
# p4c/build ; make check` to succeed.
sudo pip3 install scapy
# Earlier versions of this script installed the Ubuntu package
# python-ipaddr.  However, that no longer exists in Ubuntu 20.04.  PIP
# for Python3 can install the ipaddr module, which is good enough to
# enable two of p4c's many tests to pass, tests that failed if the
# ipaddr Python3 module is not installed, in my testing on
# 2020-Oct-17.  From the Python stack trace that appears when running
# those failing tests, the code that requires this module is in
# behavioral-model's runtime_CLI.py source file, in a function named
# ipv6Addr_to_bytes.
sudo pip3 install ipaddr

# Things needed for PTF
sudo pip3 install pypcap

# Things needed for `cd tutorials/exercises/basic ; make run` to work:

# The install steps for p4lang/PI and p4lang/behavioral-model end
# up installing Python module code in the site-packages directory
# mentioned below in this function.  That is were GNU autoconf's
# 'configure' script seems to find as the place to put them.

# On Ubuntu systems when you run the versions of Python that are
# installed via Debian/Ubuntu packages, they only look in a
# sibling dist-packages directory, never the site-packages one.

# If I could find a way to change the part of the install script
# so that p4lang/PI and p4lang/behavioral-model install their
# Python modules in the dist-packages directory, that sounds
# useful, but I have not found a way.

# As a workaround, after finishing the part of the install script
# for those packages, I will invoke this function to move them all
# into the dist-packages directory.
